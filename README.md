Notes on Implementation

    Design Principles: Keep the UI intuitive and user-friendly. Use clear labels and group related functionalities together. Consider a responsive design for different devices.

    Feedback Mechanisms: Provide users with feedback for actions (e.g., successful borrow request, errors in form submission).

    Security: Ensure secure handling of user passwords and personal information, particularly in login and user management sections.

    Consistency: Maintain a consistent layout and design language across different views for ease of use.
